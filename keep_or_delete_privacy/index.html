      <h1>Privacy Policy – Keep or Delete</h1>
      <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> February 19, 2026</p>

      <div class="card">
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy describes how the
          <strong>Keep or Delete</strong> mobile application ("App") handles
          information when you use our service. The App is designed to help you
          review and organize
          <strong>photos and videos stored on your device</strong> by allowing
          you to keep or delete them using simple swipe gestures.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Summary:</strong> Keep or Delete
          <strong>does not collect or transmit</strong> your photos, videos, or
          personal data to external servers. All processing happens locally on
          your device.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>1. Personal Data Collection</h2>
      <p>
        Keep or Delete <strong>does not collect personal data</strong> such as
        name, email address, phone number, location data, or advertising
        identifiers.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Access to Media Files</h2>
      <p>
        In order to function properly, the App may request permission from your
        Android device to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Access photos and videos stored on your device.</li>
        <li>Delete media files selected by you after confirmation.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The App only accesses the media files and basic metadata required for
        its functionality (such as file date, type, or size when available).
        <strong
          >No photos or videos are uploaded or transmitted externally.</strong
        >
      </p>

      <h2>3. How We Use the Information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Organize your media by month.</li>
        <li>Display previews of photos and videos.</li>
        <li>Allow you to mark items to keep or delete.</li>
        <li>Execute deletion only after your confirmation.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Local Storage</h2>
      <p>
        The App may store certain preferences locally on your device, such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Whether you have completed the tutorial.</li>
        <li>Your temporary keep/delete decisions until confirmation.</li>
        <li>Theme preference (light or dark mode).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This information remains stored only on your device and can be removed
        by uninstalling the App or clearing its data in Android system settings.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
      <p>
        Keep or Delete <strong>does not share</strong> your photos, videos, or
        personal data with third parties. The App does not use external servers
        to collect user data.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Third-Party Libraries</h2>
      <p>
        The App may use third-party libraries to manage permissions, access
        media files, or display video previews. These libraries operate locally
        on your device. The App does not integrate analytics or tracking
        services by default.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Android Deletion Confirmation</h2>
      <p>
        In newer Android versions, the system may require additional
        confirmation before deleting media files. This is a security feature
        enforced by Android. Keep or Delete respects these system protections
        and will only delete files after your explicit confirmation.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Security</h2>
      <p>
        The App is designed to process all data locally and minimize exposure.
        However, no method of electronic storage is 100% secure. We recommend
        keeping your Android device updated and backing up your data regularly.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Keep or Delete is not directed to children and does not knowingly
        collect personal data from minors.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be
        reflected by updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this page.
      </p>
